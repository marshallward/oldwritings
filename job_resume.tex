\textbf{Recent Research/Employment Experience} \\
\begin{tabular}{lp{6.15in}}
& PhD Dissertation: \emph{Nonlinear Influence of Potential Vorticity on Gravity Waves in a Rotating Shallow Water Fluid}\\
\\
& A multiple timescale analysis of the rotating shallow water equations has shown that the potential vorticity-carrying flow (or the eddy field) evolves independently of any gravity waves present. Through a similar analysis, we have shown that the converse is not true: the evolution of the gravity wavefield is influenced by a background potential vorticity field. We seek to quantify this interaction through the scattering of gravity wave packets off of localized eddy fields. These results may call into question the coherence of such waves over long times, and their ability to induce large-scale mixing in the ocean.\\

& Programmer, Gorilla Systems Corporation \\
\\
& Independently developed a simple 3D ray tracer for the Game Boy Advance, which required development of optimized ray tracing equations and was implementation using hardware-based 2D affine graphics transformations and hardware interrupts. Work has been used in the titles \emph{The Proud Family} and \emph{Strawberry Shortcake: Riding Camp}. \\
\\
 & Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: \emph{Double Diffusive Gravity Currents Under Rotation} \\
\\
& We have performed a series of experiments demonstrating that the rate of transport and lateral structure of a rotating, inertially driven two-layer gravity current is strongly modified when double diffusive processes occur across the interface. This effect was quantified by comparing the displacement rate of nondiffusive and various double-diffusive currents. We have also devised a method for estimating the solute transport across the interface through a combination of conductivity and refractive index measurements. This work was done in collaboration with George Veronis (Yale University, NAS) and is being prepared for publication. \\
