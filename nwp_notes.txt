Rough Idea for a NWP course:

The goal is to make it a HOWTO course, where the student will have a small 
library of self-written models at their disposal by the end of the course.

I would hope that the following are possible:

1) Barotropic Vorticity Equation

2) Quasigeostrophic Shallow Water Equation

3) Shallow Water Equation with IGW's

4) N-layered Equation (full and QG?)

And, well, I really don't know NWP so I don't know what else to add!
(I guess that I have no business writing this)

5) Parameterizing the hard stuff?

1) Barotropic Vorticity Equation
================================

  a) Writing a Poisson Solver
     ------------------------
  This is a good chance to teach finite differencing, and introduction to 
  solving elliptic linear PDEs. 

    i) Gaussian Elimination (I don't actually know this :o )
      * Demonstrate the basics: pivoting, et. al. 
      * Show how slow it is

    ii) Iterative
       * Richardson, Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, SOR

    iii) Conjugate Gradient? Krylov?

    iv) Multigrid? "Fast Poisson Solver"? Multipole? Probably too much

  b) Advection
     ---------
    i) Standard centered Jacobian
      * Illustrate nonlinear instability

    ii) Phillips's and Orzsag's dealiasing (I don't know this)

    iii) Arakawa Jacobian
        * Stable, but how correct is it?
        * Good way to encourage spectral approach

    iv) Diffusion as a stabilizer should be mentioned in some context

    v) Timestepping should also be an issue here, though I do not fully 
       appreciate it in this context

  c) Spectral Model
     --------------
    i) DFT and the FFT

    ii) Yeah... let's be honest, I never learned much about spectral models
